A hand count give me 22 different products with general characteristics
![Analysis with 3 deep levels]("docs/graph_level_3_analysis.png")
Nevertless, this process is not automatic and I'm loosing info about the number of products that have an specific quality. Per example if you have 3 mi 10 phones, 1 of those 3 phones can be lite, with this visual approach is not possible to see that.
One way to improve this is to have a counter with the number of products you want to generate.
## pros

## cons
* Some data is lost due to the usage of deep graph levels
